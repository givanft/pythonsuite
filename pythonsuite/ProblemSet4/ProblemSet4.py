	Implement a program that:

		- Expects the user to specify as a command-line argument the number of Bitcoins, n, that they would like to buy. 
			If that argument cannot be converted to a float, the program should exit via sys.exit with an error message.
		- Queries the API for the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index at https://api.coindesk.com/v1/bpi/currentprice.json, which returns a JSON object, 
			among whose nested keys is the current price of Bitcoin as a float. Be sure to catch any exceptions, as with code like: except requests.RequestException
		- Outputs the current cost of n Bitcoins in USD to four decimal places, using ',' as a thousands separator.

	This is LITTLE PROFESSOR problem

	Implement a program that:

		- Prompts the user for a level n. If the user does not input 1, 2, or 3, the program should prompt again.
		- Randomly generates ten (10) math problems formatted as X + Y = , wherein each of X and Y is a non-negative integer with  digits. 
			No need to support operations other than addition (+).
		- Prompts the user to solve each of those problem. If an answer is not correct (or not even a number), the program should output EEE and prompt the user again, 
			allowing the user up to three tries in total. If the user has still not answered correctly after three tries, the program should output the correct answer.
		- The program should ultimately output the user's score, a number out of 10.
